# Snake clone using Raylib and C
This project was built using the Raylib quickstart template and with C.


## A better implementation

To see a better implementation of snake using C and Raylib refer to:
> https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-games/tree/master/classics/src

  In this repo you will find other classic games, but under snake.c a much better implemented snake game can be found. This implementation is wholly of my own solution, but looks quite ineffecient when compared to another's, but this is how we learn. Enjoy.
